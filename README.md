# üëã Hi there

I'm Maicon Wagner, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at Ilegra and SCCON. </br>
With over 10 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.


# üöÄ Expertise

Passionate about crafting interactive and intuitive user experiences, I specialize in front-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. With almost 10 years dedicated to honing my skills in front-end technologies, I've led teams, designed system guidelines, and upheld the highest standards in web performance and SEO.

Leadership profile and problem solver, I act pragmatically, always thinking about delivering the best product with the highest quality possible, I have good communication and always seek to act transparently and with confidence to resolve all conflicts and daily challenges.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Front-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier user interfaces, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I've embraced the role of a "content creator" within the technology sphere. My approach is distinct; I aim to offer a fresh perspective on tech, blending insights with a dash of humor.
